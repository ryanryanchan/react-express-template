# react-express-template

Project setup for a basic two tier (react frontend, express backend) app hosted in docker. Includes basic eslint/prettier config.

To install eslint and prettier globally:

sudo npx install-peerdeps eslint-config-airbnb -g

sudo npx install-peerdeps eslint-plugin-prettier -g

You will also need the VSCode eslint and prettier plugins.

If you are running into ESLint issues, try running npm update -g to update all packages globally.
